# pkg_commit

After a couple decades of package maintainership, half of that with [each package in two simultaneous repositories](https://schmonz.com/2013/03/10/permanent-cvs-temporary-git/), I got tired of the manual steps to commit new and updated packages. Now I can more easily keep my packages current, and maybe even create more packages than I otherwise would.

These scripts might also be useful to other pkgsrc developers, probably after decoupling some bits that are particular to my own needs. I'd be happy for that.

## Installation

1. Place the scripts somewhere in `$PATH`.
